Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
This project is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features a 3x3 game board where two players take turns to mark cells with "X" or "O". 
The game automatically checks for winning combinations or a draw and displays the result.
Players can restart the game at any time using the provided button. 
The design is clean, responsive, and minimalistic, ensuring a smooth user experience.
To play, simply open the index.html file in a browser, and enjoy the game.
Future enhancements could include adding AI for single-player mode, animations, sounds, and customizable player names.
